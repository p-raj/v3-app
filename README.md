# v3-app
This project manages the web and native(android & ios) interfaces for v3 and there are high chances that it'll also manage VR in future.

##

###Problem
- The very first problem that we had was to manage multiple platforms with a single codebase, or as we call it, write one user anywhere.
- Next being to render/install applications at runtime.

##
###Solution
- React-Native along with [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) was the obvious and best (at the time we began) way to go with to solve the problem of write once use everywhere.
- Implementation of  [Jasonette](https://docs.jasonette.com/) is what we were inspired from and mostly followed to solve the problem of rendering at runtime.
